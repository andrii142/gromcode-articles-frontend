## Code quality (javascript)

### Don't use:
1. Naming of files/funcs/variables is important
2. Magical numbers or strinags
---
3. Nesting of the code, more than 2
4. Too much if/else statements
5. Duplicates of the code
6. Variable that is used only once
7. For/while and other loops, use arrays methods
---
8. Redundant iteration throught arrays or objects - speed
9. Take attention to the memory usage, don't create new array if it is not needed
10. Divide your code into logical blocks
11. BIG code blocks (inside {} - if, loop or array methods)
---
12. Every line of code should be easy to read
13. Every piece of code must be tested
